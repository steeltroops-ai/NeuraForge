# NeuraForge OS Project Analysis Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for performing a comprehensive analysis of the NeuraForge OS project, identifying issues, and systematically resolving them to ensure the project is production-ready and follows best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Project Structure Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand the complete project structure and organization, so that I can identify architectural issues and inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the project structure THEN the system SHALL identify all configuration files and their purposes
2. WHEN examining the monorepo setup THEN the system SHALL verify proper workspace configuration and dependencies
3. WHEN reviewing directory organization THEN the system SHALL check alignment with established patterns and best practices
4. IF duplicate or conflicting structures exist THEN the system SHALL flag them as critical issues

### Requirement 2: Dependency and Configuration Assessment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all dependencies are properly configured and compatible, so that the project builds and runs without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing package.json files THEN the system SHALL identify version conflicts and missing dependencies
2. WHEN examining TypeScript configurations THEN the system SHALL verify consistency across packages
3. WHEN reviewing build configurations THEN the system SHALL ensure proper Turborepo setup
4. IF dependency vulnerabilities exist THEN the system SHALL report them with severity levels

### Requirement 3: Code Quality and Standards Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify code quality issues and ensure adherence to coding standards, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning source code THEN the system SHALL identify syntax errors and TypeScript compilation issues
2. WHEN analyzing code patterns THEN the system SHALL detect unused imports, variables, and dead code
3. WHEN reviewing error handling THEN the system SHALL identify missing try-catch blocks and error boundaries
4. WHEN checking coding standards THEN the system SHALL verify ESLint and Prettier compliance

### Requirement 4: Runtime Functionality Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the application runs correctly and all core functionality works, so that users can successfully use the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the development server THEN the system SHALL successfully launch both frontend and backend services
2. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL verify all routes respond correctly
3. WHEN checking WebSocket functionality THEN the system SHALL ensure real-time features work properly
4. WHEN testing user authentication THEN the system SHALL verify login/logout flows function correctly

### Requirement 5: Performance and Security Assessment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify performance bottlenecks and security vulnerabilities, so that the application is fast and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing bundle sizes THEN the system SHALL identify oversized packages and optimization opportunities
2. WHEN reviewing security practices THEN the system SHALL check for exposed secrets and insecure configurations
3. WHEN testing load performance THEN the system SHALL measure response times and identify bottlenecks
4. WHEN checking accessibility THEN the system SHALL verify WCAG compliance and screen reader compatibility

### Requirement 6: Issue Documentation and Prioritization

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want a comprehensive list of all identified issues with clear priorities, so that I can plan resolution efforts effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting issues THEN the system SHALL categorize them by type (critical, performance, quality, security, accessibility)
2. WHEN assigning priorities THEN the system SHALL use clear levels (high, medium, low) based on impact
3. WHEN estimating effort THEN the system SHALL provide realistic time estimates for each issue
4. WHEN identifying dependencies THEN the system SHALL map relationships between issues

### Requirement 7: Systematic Issue Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to systematically resolve issues in order of priority, so that the most critical problems are fixed first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resolving issues THEN the system SHALL start with highest priority items
2. WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL update task status to track progress
3. WHEN completing fixes THEN the system SHALL re-test to ensure no new issues are introduced
4. WHEN all critical issues are resolved THEN the system SHALL verify the application is fully functional

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Reporting

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want clear documentation of all findings and resolutions, so that I can understand the project's health and improvements made.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive report of all findings
2. WHEN issues are resolved THEN the system SHALL document the solutions implemented
3. WHEN testing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide verification of functionality
4. WHEN the project is ready THEN the system SHALL confirm production readiness
