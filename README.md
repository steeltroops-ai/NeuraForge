# NeuraForge

**The AI-Native Research Operating System**

NeuraForge is the world's first AI-agent-native research platform that transforms how humanity conducts scientific discovery. By orchestrating specialized AI research agents alongside human researchers, we're building the infrastructure for accelerated knowledge creation and breakthrough discoveries.

## Mission

Solving humanity's hardest problems through AI-powered research collaboration. NeuraForge provides the operating system where AI agents and human researchers work together to tackle complex challenges in medicine, climate, AI safety, and beyond.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development servers
bun run dev

# Build for production
bun run build
```

## Core Capabilities

### Multi-Agent Research Orchestration
- **Domain-Specialized AI Agents**: Math, coding, physics, biology, policy agents working in parallel
- **Long-Context Reasoning Memory**: Persistent knowledge graphs across research projects
- **Experiment Design Engine**: AI agents propose hypotheses and design methodologies
- **Literature Mining**: Auto-digest and cross-reference insights from academic databases

### Research Workflow Superpowers
- **Semantic Research Workspace**: Interactive research canvases with graphs, equations, AI commentary
- **Automated Citation & Verification**: Every claim linked to papers, datasets, experiment logs
- **Collaborative Agent-Human Papers**: AI co-writes, humans critique, near-submission-ready drafts
- **Lab Notebook Mode**: Version-controlled experiments with agent-generated summaries

### Network & Collaboration Layer
- **Researcher-Agent Pairs**: Persistent AI co-researchers tuned to specific domains
- **Cross-Lab Knowledge Federation**: Secure insight sharing between teams and organizations
- **Peer Review Simulation**: AI agents role-play reviewers to stress-test arguments
- **Debate Arena**: Multiple agents pressure-test hypotheses through structured debate

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with React 18+ and TypeScript
- **Backend**: Fastify with Socket.io for real-time collaboration
