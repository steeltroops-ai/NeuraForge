# Build-a-thon 2025 Submission - Simple Version

## Project Name
NeuraForge

## Elevator Pitch (50 characters)
AI agents accelerating scientific discovery

## Inspiration

As a solo developer, I've seen how researchers waste 60% of their time on repetitive tasks instead of actual discovery. I started NeuraForge to change that.

Most hackathon teams build small, safe projects. I'm building something bigger: a complete research operating system that could become a real company.

This is not just a hackathon project. This is the foundation of a startup that will help humanity solve major challenges like disease and climate change.

The vision is clear and necessary. This has to exist.

## What it does

NeuraForge is an AI research operating system that coordinates specialized AI agents to work with human researchers.

Core features:

1. Multi-Agent Orchestration: Deploy AI agents for math, coding, physics, biology, and policy. They work together on research problems.

2. Semantic Workspace: Interactive canvases with graphs, equations, and visualizations. The UI is functional and polished.

3. Collaborative Paper Writing: AI helps write research papers with automated citations and formatting.

4. Lab Notebook: Version-controlled experiments with AI summaries.

5. Real-time Collaboration: Multiple researchers work together simultaneously. WebSocket infrastructure is live.

Current state: Frontend is 70% complete. Backend is 40% complete. The foundation is solid.

Impact on themes:
- Education: Makes research accessible to students without institutional resources
- Automation: Eliminates repetitive research tasks
- Green Technology: Accelerates climate research

## How I built it

I built this as a production-ready monorepo with professional architecture:

- Monorepo: Turborepo with 6 shared packages
- Frontend: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript strict mode (70% complete)
- Backend: Fastify with Socket.io (40% complete)
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma (schema ready)
- UI: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, Framer Motion (polished)
- Runtime: Bun for speed

What I've done:
- Designed complete system architecture
- Built real-time WebSocket infrastructure
- Created polished semantic workspace UI
- Set up professional code quality tools
- Implementing AI orchestration system

This is production code, not throwaway hackathon code.

## Challenges I ran into

1. Real-time synchronization: Building WebSocket infrastructure for multiple AI agents and users working together.

2. AI context management: Designing a system to route information to the right specialized agents.

3. Performance: Optimizing complex visualizations to run smoothly.

4. Solo development: Building a monorepo with 2 apps and 6 packages alone is challenging.

5. Time management: Balancing this with studies and life.

6. Courage: Submitting unfinished work instead of a safe, small demo.

## Accomplishments

Technical:
- Production-ready monorepo architecture
- Polished frontend that looks professional
- Working real-time infrastructure
- Scalable system design
- Professional code quality setup

Personal:
- Built something ambitious instead of safe
- Learned advanced architecture in 3 days
- Created foundation for a real startup
- Proved I can build at scale

This project is unfinished but unforgettable. Other teams built small finished demos. I'm building something that could change the world.

## What I learned

Technical:
- Monorepo architecture improves organization
- Bun is faster than npm
- Real-time systems need careful design
- TypeScript strict mode catches bugs early
- Good architecture saves time

Product:
- Simplicity matters more than complexity
- Real-time collaboration is essential
- Specialized AI agents are more useful
- Research needs version control

Personal:
- I can build production systems alone
- Deadlines force good prioritization
- Vision matters as much as execution

## What's next

Next 2 weeks:
- Complete backend AI orchestration
- Launch alpha with 10 researchers
- Raise pre-seed funding ($500K-$1M)
- Go all-in on NeuraForge as startup

3 months:
- Complete all features
- Launch beta with 100 researchers
- Partner with 5 universities
- Hire 2-3 engineers

Startup plan:
- Freemium model: Free for students, paid for institutions
- Pro tier: $29/month
- Enterprise: $10K-$100K/year
- 10% of revenue funds research in developing countries

5-year vision:
- Year 1: 10,000 users, $500K revenue
- Year 2: 100,000 users, $5M revenue
- Year 3: 500,000 users, partnerships with top universities
- Year 4: 2M users, $100M revenue
- Year 5: 10M users, $500M revenue

Long-term impact:
- Medicine: Faster drug discovery
- Climate: Accelerate carbon capture research
- AI Safety: Speed up alignment research
- Education: Make research accessible globally

This is not just a project. This is a revolution in scientific discovery.
