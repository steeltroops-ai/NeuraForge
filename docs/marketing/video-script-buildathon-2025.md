# NeuraForge - Build-a-thon 2025 Demo Video Script
Duration: 3-4 minutes

## SCENE 1: INTRODUCTION (0:00-0:30)

[Screen: You on camera]

You speaking:
"Hi, I'm [Your Name]. I'm a solo developer, and I built NeuraForge for Build-a-thon 2025.

NeuraForge is an AI-native research operating system that helps researchers work faster by coordinating specialized AI agents.

The frontend is 70% complete. The backend is 40% complete. But the vision is 100% clear.

Let me show you what I'm building."

## SCENE 2: CORE FEATURES (0:30-2:00)

[Screen: Navigate through the UI]

Voiceover:
"NeuraForge has five core features.

First, multi-agent orchestration. Researchers can deploy specialized AI agents for mathematics, coding, physics, biology, and policy. These agents work together on complex research problems.

[Screen: Show workspace interface]

Second, the semantic research workspace. This is where researchers interact with data visualizations, equations, and research notes. The UI is fully functional with smooth animations and intuitive controls.

[Screen: Show real-time collaboration]

Third, real-time collaboration. Multiple researchers can work on the same project simultaneously. The WebSocket infrastructure is live and working.

[Screen: Show paper writing interface]

Fourth, collaborative paper writing. AI agents will help write research papers with automated citation verification and formatting.

[Screen: Show lab notebook concept]

Fifth, lab notebook mode. Version-controlled experiment tracking with AI-generated summaries to make research reproducible."

## SCENE 3: TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE (2:00-2:30)

[Screen: Show code and architecture]

Voiceover:
"The technical foundation is solid.

I built this as a Turborepo monorepo with 2 apps and 6 shared packages. The frontend uses Next.js 14, React 18, and TypeScript in strict mode. The backend uses Fastify with Socket.io for real-time features.

[Screen: Show database schema]

The database is PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM. The schema is designed and migrations are ready.

[Screen: Show tech stack overview]

This is production-grade architecture built for scale, not just a hackathon demo."

## SCENE 4: IMPACT (2:30-3:15)

[Screen: Back to you on camera]

You speaking:
"NeuraForge addresses all three hackathon themes.

For education, it makes advanced research accessible to students who lack institutional resources. A high school student could use NeuraForge to contribute to real research.

For automation, it eliminates repetitive tasks. Researchers spend 60% of their time on literature reviews and data analysis. NeuraForge automates this.

For green technology, it accelerates climate research. Faster hypothesis testing means faster breakthroughs in carbon capture and renewable energy.

[Screen: Show market opportunity]

The market for research tools is over 10 billion dollars. Most existing tools don't use modern AI. NeuraForge will change that."

## SCENE 5: NEXT STEPS (3:15-3:45)

[Screen: You on camera]

You speaking:
"After this hackathon, I'm completing the backend AI orchestration system and launching an alpha version with 10 researchers.

Then I'm raising pre-seed funding to turn NeuraForge into a real startup.

The business model is freemium. Free for students and individual researchers. Paid tiers for institutions.

[Screen: Show roadmap]

Within a year, the goal is 10,000 users and partnerships with universities. Within five years, NeuraForge could serve 10 million researchers worldwide."

## SCENE 6: CLOSING (3:45-4:00)

[Screen: You on camera, confident]

You speaking:
"NeuraForge is not finished, but the foundation is strong. I'm building this to democratize research and accelerate scientific discovery.

## FILMING TIPS

Keep it simple and professional:

1. Use good lighting (natural window light or desk lamp)
2. Clear audio (phone earbuds or laptop mic close to you)
3. Clean background
4. Speak clearly and at a steady pace
5. Practice the script 3-5 times before recording

Screen recording:
1. Record at 1080p resolution
2. Show only working features
3. Keep mouse movements smooth
4. Use 3-5 second clips for each feature

Editing:
1. Use free software like DaVinci Resolve or iMovie
2. Add subtle background music at low volume
3. Add text overlays for key points
4. Keep transitions simple (fade or cut)
5. Export at 1080p, 30fps

Total production time: 2-3 hours
