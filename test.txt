1. Mission

Create a global, AI-native research and innovation ecosystem that enables individuals, teams, and AI agents to collaboratively solve humanity’s most difficult scientific, technological, and social problems—both digitally and in future physical labs.

Key Principles:

Open collaboration across domains, geographies, and expertise levels.

Transparent, version-controlled research that avoids redundancy and preserves knowledge.

AI augmentation at every stage: hypothesis generation, research planning, pattern discovery, and outcome prediction.

Rapid iteration: reduce concept-to-deployment time from decades to months.

2. Core Problems Addressed

Fragmentation: Research is siloed in universities, corporations, or governments.

Redundancy: Duplicate efforts waste time/resources.

Knowledge loss: Half-finished experiments and unpublished negative results are lost.

Accessibility: Paywalls, credentials, and funding barriers prevent global participation.

Inefficient collaboration: Real-time co-development, versioning, and AI augmentation are largely missing.

3. Target Users & Stakeholders

Professional scientists & engineers

Hobbyist researchers and citizen scientists

AI research agents (autonomous agents that analyze and propose research)

Labs, universities, and funding organizations

NGOs, think tanks, global research initiatives

Roles / Capabilities:

Contributor: creates experiments, datasets, or projects

Collaborator: joins and improves projects

Reviewer: validates results, resolves conflicts

AI Agent: generates hypotheses, discovers patterns, suggests forks, analyzes results

4. Platform Core Features
A. Research Trees

Hierarchical, forkable projects → sub-goals → milestones → experiments

Branch, merge, compare, and version all research elements

Visual canvas for nodes, real-time updates

B. AI-Powered Tools

Hypothesis generation from existing project data and global knowledge

Semantic search across datasets, publications, and internal results

Related research suggestions, including failed attempts and partial results

Autonomous AI agents monitoring project progress

C. Collaborative Workspaces

Real-time co-editing of documents, code, datasets

Version control for all project artifacts

AI suggestions integrated contextually

D. Knowledge Graph & Visualization

Interactive mapping of ideas, experiments, contributors, and relationships

Cross-domain connection highlighting hidden patterns

E. Analytics & Impact Tracking

Contributor reputation, citations, forks, and impact metrics

Heatmaps of active research fields and emerging trends

AI-predicted future impact of projects

F. Physical Integration Roadmap

Future network of open-access labs and manufacturing hubs

Sync digital research with physical experiments

G. Supportive Systems

Notifications, feeds, and AI alerts

Export/import capabilities, APIs for integration

Secure data encryption, granular access control

Decentralized governance for open research standards

5. Technical Foundations

Modular, microservice-based architecture

AI-native: LLMs for hypothesis generation, semantic search, and agent actions

Real-time data layer (WebSocket / PubSub) for collaboration

Graph-based databases for versioned research trees & knowledge graphs

Cloud/object storage for datasets & artifacts

Frontend: high-performance, WebGL-enabled visualizations

6. Implementation Goals

Short-term (Poc/Prototype):

Demonstrate branching, merging, and version-controlled research tree

AI-assisted suggestion of next experiments

Minimal collaborative workspace with document/code editing

Simple visualization of research nodes & branches

Mid-term (MVP):

Full knowledge graph & semantic search

Contributor reputation & impact analytics

AI agents capable of autonomous hypothesis generation and reporting

Integration with select open labs for live experiment data

Long-term:

Global network of physical labs & cloud-connected instruments

Fully autonomous AI agents collaborating across projects

Open, decentralized governance & API ecosystem

7. Success Criteria

Users can create, fork, merge, and complete projects without confusion

AI suggestions improve research speed, avoid redundant experiments

Knowledge graph surfaces cross-domain insights that humans alone would miss

Impact is measurable: faster experimental cycles, increased collaboration, reduced duplication

8. Key Constraints

Data privacy & safety: sensitive experiments must be controlled

AI reliability: suggestions must be validated, negative/failed results preserved

Scalability: must support thousands of concurrent users and projects

Accessibility: users worldwide with minimal barriers to entry

9. Next Steps for Agent Execution

Map full platform architecture: backend, frontend, AI services, database models

Define data schema: projects, branches, commits, artifacts, users, AI suggestions

Prototype research tree: branching, merging, AI suggestions

Build AI agent behavior rules: when to propose, merge, or flag experiments

Design frontend interactions: branch canvas, commit creation, AI suggestion panel

Simulate early collaborations: test impact on knowledge sharing and workflow

Iterate on usability & AI feedback loops
